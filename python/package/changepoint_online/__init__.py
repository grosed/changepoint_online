"""A Collection of Methods for Online Changepoint Detection

The changepoint_online package provides efficient algorithms for detecting 
changes in data streams based on the Focus algorithm. 
The Focus algorithm solves the CUSUM likelihood-ratio test exactly in O(log(n))
time per iteration, where n represents the current iteration.
The method is equivalent to running a rolling window (MOSUM) simultaneously 
for all sizes of windows or the Page-CUSUM for all possible values of the
size of change (an infinitely dense grid).


Key Features
------------
    Contains all focus exponential family algorithms as well as 
        the NPFOCuS algorithm for non-parametric changepoint detection.
    It's versatile enough to be applied in scenarios where the pre-change 
        parameter is either known or unknown. 
    It is possible to apply constraints to detect specific types of changes
        (such as increases or decreases in parameter values).

Quick Example
-------------
    ```python

    ### Simple gaussian change in mean case ###
    from changepoint_online import Focus, Gaussian
    import numpy as np

    np.random.seed(0)
    Y = np.concatenate((np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=5000), np.random.normal(loc=10.0, scale=1.0, size=5000)))

    detector = Focus(Gaussian())
    threshold = 10.0
    for y in Y:
        detector.update(y)
        if detector.statistic() >= threshold:
            break

    result = detector.changepoint()
    print(f"We detected a changepoint at time {result['stopping_time']}.")
    ```
